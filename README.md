# Accident-Risk-Prevention
This project, titled "Accident Risk Prevention," involved leading a team of four in developing a predictive model to identify and mitigate accident risks. Utilizing Python for data analysis and machine learning, we tackled the challenge of imbalanced data by applying the SMOTE technique to improve model performance. The project prominently featured the use of Tableau for in-depth data reporting and visualization, enabling us to extract and communicate actionable insights to effectively address accident risk factors. Through this initiative, we enhanced the predictive model's accuracy and contributed to reducing potential accident risks.  Technologies used: Python, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Tableau.
