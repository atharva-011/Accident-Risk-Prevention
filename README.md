# Accident-Risk-Prevention
This project, titled "Accident Risk Prevention" revolves around developing a predictive model to identify and mitigate accident risks. Utilizing Python for data analysis and machine learning, we tackled the challenge of imbalanced data by applying the SMOTE technique to improve model performance. We also use Tableau for in-depth data reporting and visualization, enabling us to extract and communicate actionable insights to identify accident risk factors. 


Focus on:  Python, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Tableau.
